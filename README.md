**Hey, how are you!?**

My name is Victor Soler, I'm a Junior Python Developer, a casual gamer and an amateur cook. I'm embarking on the path of programming in pursuit of a dream.
I live in Guarulhos, São Paulo - Brazil. 


- 👨🏽‍💻 Code Apprentice: Trying to understand this world of bits and bytes while learning and developing in python.
- 🎮 Weekend Gamer: If you need to find me in the weekends, I'll probably be in some FPS or trying to relax with some simulation.
- 🍳 Amateur Chef: My cooking attempts are mostly very good. But some are nothing more than edible.
- 🎓 Former Admin, Future Dev: From pies charts to codes, I am transforming my career towards software development through Python.
- 🚧 Most Recent Project: [Park Encantado](https://github.com/vmagueta/parkencantado), a website with an administrative area for a park located in Portugal.
